# Principles

1. Remove friction from devs as much as possible.
    1. If a complex action takes more than one time to execute manually, automate it.

    1. Do not pollute PRs with styling comments. Leave it to the linters and formatters to do the job.

    1. Whenever possible, reuse established rules, policies, extensions, etc...
